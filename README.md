Urinal Etiquette
================

Urinal Etiquette determines the ideal use order of urinals to minimise the chances that any two occupants stand next to each other. Based on several comedy articles / videos floating around the internet.

This application will attempt to accomplish the following:

- As occupants enter, they are assigned to a urinal which is not neighbouring another occupied urinal, and which is the least likely to result in a subsequent occupant standing adjacent to an occupied stall
- In the case that an occupant must be put in a stall adjacent to another occupied stall(s), it will choose the stall which exposes the occupant to the least number of people for the least amount of time
- In the case where all stalls are occupied, a queue will form
  - Occupants in queue will take the first stall available, respecting the optimal usage order described above
